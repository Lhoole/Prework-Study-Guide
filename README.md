# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

A basic study guide made during the prework for my coding bootcamp. I made this site to get the basics of HTML, CSS and Java. It will be a reference point for some of the things I have learned so far and has helped me consolidate the information I have been reading.

## Installation

## Usage

This site is used to display key notes from what I have learned in each topic and has JavaScript running in the devtools (Command+Option+I on macOS or Control+Shift+I on Windows) to both list topics and generate a topic to study from that list.
